This is another adorable nebula in the sky. But apart from its beauty, there is something remarkable about the carina nebula. There is a star in this nebula named Eta Carinae. Being one of the brightest and most massive stars in the sky, it has been puzzling scientist by showing unusual fluctuations in its luminosity.                                                             

Around the 1840s, this star underwent a great eruption of about two to three suns' worth of material from the star's polar regions, there by showing a brightness of 4.8 magnitudes, a magnitude not observed in this star since the Great Eruption.
