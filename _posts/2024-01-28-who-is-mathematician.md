# Who is this Mathematician ? 

> **“Mathematics is not only seen as beautiful—beauty is also mathematical. The two are intertwined”**  -Dr. Thomas Britz.
She was sitting on the swing in a garden on a fine evening. The sunset looked mesmerising. As the colours of the sunset painted the sky with orange and red, she felt a connection to the universe. She looked around at things with amusement as if she had got new eyes.

The garden had people, who were busy with their lives as usual. But today she noticed someone who was looking closely at the sunflowers. She started to think, "At first it seemed normal, anyone could be adoring the beauty of flowers. But later realised that's not what he was doing!" She decided to ask.

As she stood near in hesitation and confusion, he noticed her and asked, 
<div style="max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto;">
    <div style="margin: 10px 0; border-radius: 15px; overflow: hidden; background-color: #add8e6; color: #333; box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); word-wrap: break-word; max-width: 80%;">
            <div style="padding: 12px;">
                "Have you ever happened to observe the symmetry in this flower?" 
            </div>
    </div>
She looked at the beautiful pattern. He went on,
     <div style="margin: 10px 0; border-radius: 15px; overflow: hidden; background-color: #add8e6; color: #333; box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); word-wrap: break-word; max-width: 80%;">
            <div style="padding: 12px;">
                "Nature is so perfect! Maybe nature loves mathematics. Have you ever noticed that from plants such as sunflowers to animals and insects like butterflies, starfish, and even we humans, all the way to large structures like spiral galaxies—everything seems to follow a certain symmetrical and mathematical pattern! But why?"

            QuantumBoy's message goes here. It can be a long message that will wrap to the next line as needed and goes further.
