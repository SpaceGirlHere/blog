# The Purpose - From Philosophy to Physics

> **But how could you live and have no story to tell?** - Fyodor Dostoevsky 

## Asking questions

Our lives will inevitably tell a story, but we should carefully consider if it is the story we want to tell and if it is the life we want to live... Have you ever been lost in the thought of the meaning of life? Have you ever thought about why you exist? Or how this world came into being? Is there a creator? If yes, why did he/she create us? And, most importantly, what is the purpose of our lives?

Hello, stargazers! **I am Khushi, and this is Space Girl !**. I am on a quest to find the answers to such questions that are often ignored by most of us throughout our lives!

To begin with, let us first address the very fundamental question: why do we exist!? Now, I want you to think for a while. Have you ever entered a thought process of finding meaning to your life? Could you find an answer? Or did you feel stuck and end up thinking life is pointless? Every person has a different purpose. But most of us never really bother to address this question. While some of us believe that life has no meaning and our existence has no purpose, we call them nihilists. Now, apart from this, there are these people who eagerly want to find the real purpose of their lives and have found various ways to contribute to the search! We call them scientists.

The search for meaning is one of the deepest desires of humankind. Observing, finding patterns, drawing conclusions, and most importantly, QUESTIONING! We question everything, and our curiosity fuels us to try hard to find the answers.

As a child, we ask questions and learn. But things start to change as the child starts growing up. As we start understanding the world around us and the way it works, we get involved in the everyday things of our life and forget to ask questions!

## The Story - How did it start for me?
There is a beginning for everyone; everyone has a story, and so it was for me.

Well, to begin, how did it start for me? Or how did I first realize that physics is what I want to do all my life? I still remember it started with a show that I watched at a planetarium. I was around 12, and it was the summer holidays. I decided to go to the planetarium with a friend. We booked a show on the Big Bang and the beginning of the universe!

That experience introduced me to the captivating world of space science and cosmology, and I was mesmerized by the beauty of the galaxies and stars. The struggle between matter and antimatter, the formation of stars, supernovae, and how our solar system came into existence!

It was an unforgettable experience, but as I walked out of the theatre, a question lingered in my mind. While it was clear that the universe began with the Big Bang, I wondered, what if nothing had happened? What if the Big Bang had not occurred? What would the world look like? Would it be a vast emptiness without stars? But then I realized that space itself was formed by the Big Bang. So, what would be there? Would it be emptiness? What does emptiness even mean? How would things have unfolded if the Big Bang had never taken place? 

Without the Big Bang, there would have been no formation of stars, galaxies, or even planets. And if that were the case, we, too, would not exist. Just think about it: if the Big Bang hadn't happened, I wouldn't be here today, contemplating all these questions in the first place. It was a chilling thought, one that haunted me for days.
Finally, it developed an urge in me to try to find answers! I started the quest! I started my journey! The sole purpose of it became the thirst to find how I exist today and why I exist today? What is my purpose? What is our purpose?


## Answering the questions
Let’s try to answer this question with an open mind! So, let’s start from how did we come into existence. Over the past centuries, people have tried to find the answer to such questions, but quest for understanding is ongoing, and we eagerly await further exploration and discovery.
