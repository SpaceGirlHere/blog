# A Magical Tale of the Cosmic Kitchen  

> **‚ÄúThe cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself.‚Äù**  - Carl Sagan.

One afternoon while she was looking at the sun from the window, the shiny object in the sky that keeps us alive and warm with its glow. Being equally beautiful and mysterious, this object interests her every now and then and makes her ponder upon its magnificent existence. Sun has the power to 'make us' as well as 'destroy us' within a blink of an eye, she thinks. But she wanted to know what makes the sun!

With a mug of something comforting in hand, she leans against the window sill, captivated by the canvas of the sky. In the ancient mythology, Surya is the Sun god. He's portrayed riding a chariot drawn by seven horses, symbolising the seven colours of a rainbow or the seven chakras in the body. Surya is believed to bring light, eliminating darkness from our lives!

Wondering about the mystery of the Sun, she remembered what she had learned in school about a star.. ‚ÄúA burning ball of gases?!‚Äù she thought. Suddenly her mother called her to the kitchen. Cooking, being a kind of mystical experience for her, always reminded her about chemistry! She learned in school how a combination of a few chemicals can make something cool. 
> Food is yet another Magical Transformation of raw items from the garden, resulting from chemical changes brought in a pan kept over a Flame ! üî•

This amazing thought made her appreciate the art of cooking while she goes to the kitchen to help her mother. As she started to chop the veggies, she continued thinking about the sun, ‚ÄúBut why is it so hot? Why is it burning? What does burning even mean?‚Äù.  A moment later she saw something interesting. Her mother began to cook the vegetables. ‚ÄúOh! Cooking is also burning or heating afterall‚Äù she said excitedly. ‚ÄúWho must be cooking the sun in the cosmic pan?‚Äù, she giggled.  Now she had an idea about what could be going inside the sun. Maybe it was better to start with what's happening with each atom inside it!  She thought of cooking her own star in the kitchen today.

"So, if I assume that some hydrogen atoms are inside this pan placed on the flame, what will happen?" she wondered. But this wasn't as simple as that. There is a lot more going on inside the sun than just heating. She remembered what QuantumBoy told her about the fundamental forces. ‚ÄúGravitational force must be sticking all hydrogen atoms together. But at such high temperatures, possibly those atoms would melt inside the pan, which means the electrons will no longer go around the nucleus,‚Äù she imagined.

"But still, this does not form a sun! What if the temperature can be increased even more?" She began to think, ‚ÄúIf I heat up the atoms so much that they become highly energetic, and their nuclei begin to collide with each other? Then, at such a small distance, the force that can glue protons and neutrons together can come into play, and possibly some nuclei might want to combine together and form a bigger nucleus!‚Äù.
> That's what actually happens inside a star throughout most of its life. It undergoes fusion of atoms, and this process releases a great amount of heat and energy. That's how our sun glows!

She could imagine nuclei of hydrogen fusing together in front of her eyes in that pan with sizzling vegetables. She continued, ‚ÄúOkay, so what's next? Maybe one day all my hydrogen atoms will combine to form bigger atoms. What will happen after that? Will this process stop? What if I don't want to take the pan off the stove? If I keep heating it more, then maybe the bigger atoms will start to combine too. I think they might form even larger-sized atoms, huge ones.‚Äù

"But this process was releasing a lot of energy that should be pushing everything outwards. But she was confused; then why doesn't the sun burst? She felt a click, 'There must be something holding it in its place. Some inward force that is still binding everything together.' That is nothing but our favourite gravitational force!"

"Throughout the life of a sun, a tug of war ensues between the outward pressure generated by thermal energy, seeking to push everything out, and the inward gravitational force, endeavouring to pull everything inside into a smaller and smaller region. 
> The sun maintains its shape as long as these forces are balanced with each other." 

‚ÄúBut do these forces ever get imbalanced? If yes, when? And then what happens to the star?‚Äù she questioned. Meanwhile, she continued to ponder the possibilities, and her mother noticed. ‚ÄúOh girl, you are so slow! I could have prepared the entire lunch by this time, and you haven‚Äôt finished chopping yet!‚Äù her mother exclaimed. But she took no notice of her as she was lost in her thoughts, busy solving another mystery of the universe!

"There comes a point when the nuclei are no longer able to fuse together to form a further bigger nucleus as no sufficient energy remains. This is the point when fusion stops, and the outward thermal pressure is overpowered by the inward gravitational force. "So, finally, one day gravitational force has to win! Then the star will start to collapse into itself and compress inward due to gravity" she concluded.

> As the star keeps compressing into smaller and smaller volumes, it can't withstand its own weight and bursts out with a huge explosion. We call it a supernova."

> What is left behind after the explosion is a dense core of the star, which becomes as dense as Earth compressed down to the size of an apple! This is known as a neutron star. If the star is big enough, what is left after a supernova is a black hole.

‚ÄúBut is this the end of the star? 
Or is there more to it than we can see? 
What happens to the leftover dense core ?‚Äù  she kept wondering.....
