# The Eternal Bond: Love from the Quantum World  

> **“When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change”**  - Max Planck.

She was walking down the street with a bag of vegetables. She was returning home. She was almost at the city centre and thought of buying some beverages from a shop near the library. While she was paying, a coin fell from her pocket. “It’s heads!”, she thought and giggled. 

She started to ponder about the nature of that coin. “Well, until the coin fell, I had no idea whether it would be heads or tails.”, she spoke to herself while drinking on a bench in front of the library. “Could there be any way in which I could know the state of this coin without looking at it?”, she kept thinking. After a while, looked around, and noticed the library..   

She went inside.There was silence inside the library. Around the corner she saw QuantumBoy sitting totally submerged into a book. She went near him. “The many worlds of Quanta….”, she started reading and he suddenly turned. “Hey! So you found me again !”. She smiled and said hello. Keeping her bag aside she sat down on a chair. 

“So what have you been reading?”, she asked. 
> He was excited about it and said, “Spooky Action at a Distance!”.

“What! Tell me more,” she said, intrigued. “It is a very interesting property of particles of quantum scale. You know we can ‘Entangle’ 2 particles, and they get connected to each other in some way such that they interact to affect each other’s properties!” 

“Oh, that sounds interesting. But how do we know they are entangled?”, she asked. “Let me explain to you this way. So, consider that we are entangled. Now this means our states are interdependent. Suppose our states correlate in a way that they’re always opposite. Like if your state is standing up , I will be found sitting down and vice versa. If somebody observes you and discovers that you are sitting down, then don't you think they can guess about my state based on the knowledge of correlation between us?”, he sighed. 
She was amazed and immediately stood up, saying, "Oh, you gave me the answer to my question! I can certainly know a coin's state even before measuring!" She laughed. He was a bit confused but he continued, “And the most interesting part is that this interaction does not depend on distance separating us!” 

“But there is something puzzling here....”, he stopped and pondered. She was impatient but waited for him to speak. “If I am correlated with you, then I must be interacting through some way to affect your state or at least letting you know what my present state is so that you can ensure that your state is indeed opposite. But that interaction takes time if you are far away from me, right?”, he said. She nodded. “But experiments suggest that this is not the case. You always simultaneously know what state you have to be in once my state is observed, even though there is not enough time for me to inform you.”

**Genesis: The Spark of Unity**

“Okay, and how to entangle 2 particles?”, she questioned. “Oh, that is easy. We can either entangle 2 already existing particles by letting them interact with each other, or we can even produce entangled pairs meaning the particles will have correlation right from their production. This can be made possible in a situation for example, when 2 photons are produced together from annihilation of 2 particles. By conservation of angular momentum, both the photons must have opposite spin upon measurement. In this case, we can say that both these photons are entangled. Or you can consider a pair of particle and anti particle popping out simultaneously inside a particle accelerator during collisions. Their properties are always correlated and interdependent. 

**Resonance: The Silent Symphony**

“Ohh, that's weird! But what are we using for interaction? As far as I know, there are only 4 fundamental forces in nature that can cause some kind of interaction between any 2 particles. Can we be interacting through any of those?”, she asked.
“That's an interesting point. Let’s consider each force on by one and see which one fits the kind of interaction an entangled pair of particles undergo!”, He exclaimed. “Well, this interaction just does not depend on distance between particles. Entangled particles still interact even if they are placed long distance apart.”, he says. “Yeah, so we can fairly rule out the possibility of Weak force and Strong force being the mode of interaction between the entangled particles…” she said. “Right, because these forces only act at short ranges (at the scale of the nucleus) and can’t be helpful for a long distance interaction,” he added. 
“So this brings us to Electromagnetic force!”, she started to get excited. “Well, let's try to entangle 2 particles using electromagnetic force.” 

He said, “Well, we can consider for example an atom. An atom consists of electrons revolving around a nucleus. These electrons are arranged in certain configurations around the nucleus and we know very well that all electrons get to interact with other electrons via electromagnetic repulsion. Now Quantum mechanics has this principle called Pauli’s exclusion principle. It says no 2 electrons with the same spin can remain in the same orbital. Can we say that the 2 electrons in an orbital are entangled or at least correlated in some sense?”

She took a moment and said, “yeah, because if 1 is spin up, the other has to be spin down, else pauli’s principle is violated!”
He smiled and continued, “But you forgot to consider the fact that electromagnetic force does depend on distance and its strength would reduce, which is not the case with entanglement.” “Right”, she said and started to think. “Also suppose if some outermost electrons leave the atom and one of the electrons happen to change its orbitals (orientations in space) and move to a different orbital in which electron must have different spin depending on pauli’s principle, will that electron still have previous spin or a new one? Will the electron violate Pauli’s principle for saving entanglement?” 

“Yeah, that's quite contradictory which again brings us to the conclusion that entanglement might not be the result of electromagnetic force!”, he said with a sigh and he knew that they are only left with gravitation now. But can gravitation really be the answer? They doubted. 

“Gravitational force, as we know it is almost considered to have negligible effect in case of subatomic particles..”, she murmured. “...because all subatomic particles have very tiny mass and gravitation is the result of mass”, he completed it. 
After a moment, she asked, “Is  it possible that the states are predetermined and were always existing with those particles from the moment the entangled particles were created?”. He replied, “that could have been a possibility, but it turns out that some experiments disproved this possibility!”. 

Einstein along with Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen(EPR Paradox) suggested the idea of predeterministic states and theorised that these states were governed by some Hidden Variables. However, in  1964 John Stewart Bell proposed a theorem that showed this idea, known as local hidden variable theories, cannot explain the correlations observed in quantum entanglement experiments. Bell's theorem demonstrated that no local hidden variable theory can reproduce all the predictions of quantum mechanics, implying that the outcomes are not predetermined but are instead fundamentally probabilistic.

 “Ahh, yet we can’t be sure about what exactly is responsible for entanglement!”, she said with disappointment. “But that doesn't stop us from trying”, he said with a smile. 

> After a pause he said, “Maybe it's time to give up the idea of Spatial locality, let's imagine it as a single wave function. Even if a single strand of thread has 2 ends, it is still the same thread”. Suddenly, a sparkle appeared in her eyes!

He went near the shelf and picked another book and said. "This takes us to an interesting idea, 
> The state of these particles can be considered as a form of information. In fact, every particle carries some information right from the moment of the Big Bang to each passing instant. Energy, momentum, angle, polarisation, every attribute is associated with some information that helps us understand the universe better. Each particle carries a unique signature of the universe's history. This intricate web of information not only holds the fundamental properties of particles but also holds the key to understanding the birth and sustainability of life itself”. 

Suddenly she happened to notice the clock on the wall and realised she was late! “I think I should take a leave now, but we will continue this discussion next time.” He nodded with a goodbye and continued to explore more.....
