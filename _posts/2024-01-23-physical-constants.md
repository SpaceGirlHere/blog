# So, what is a constant after all?

> **Physical constant, any of a set of fundamental invariant quantities observed in nature and appearing in the basic theoretical equations of physics. Accurate evaluation of these constants is essential in order to check the correctness of the theories and to allow useful applications to be made on the basis of those theories.**  Encyclopaedia Britannica

## My Story starts here

The story begins like this - She was in school, attending a lecture on gravitational force. yeah, it started in the same old way, Newton found that this force depends on the mass of the objects and reduces with distance, oh, has an inverse square proportionality. But wait, what is this constant thing? So, this force depends on this constant too, the Universal Gravitational constant! Again, please, what is it? Oh, nobody knows!?

What are CONSTANTS in an equation actually? And why do we need them in the first place? She had to think about it else this little thing on the topmost floor won’t let her rest. So, she starts like - we do know what a Constant mean. Formally speaking, it is something which doesn’t change its value whatsoever. It is possible that a value remains Constant for a particular set of conditions or within a certain context and might change otherwise. Such are the physical constants. 

For instance, if we put constraints on the distance we travel and the time we take, we can certainly say that our speed is constant! But that doesn’t mean speed is always constant. And we have another example, what about resistance of a wire? Well, resistance is a constant that we put when we remove the proportionality sign between voltage and current. (Bingo! You are right we have been calling it Ohm’s law, we always like to honour the person who really worked on it you see, you can be daydreaming for when you get a law with your name, eh) So, we know pretty well that resistance is Not a constant. It further depends on the length and cross section area of that wire and oh! We have another constant; they call it resistivity! But wait, unfortunately this is also Not a constant. Let’s dig deeper. So, recall the high school lectures, it depends on the properties of a material. So, to sum up, resistivity becomes a constant when we fix the type of material, further resistance becomes constant if the resistivity is fixed and dimensions of wire are fixed. These are the special physical conditions in which these quantities can Be a constant.

“So, does that mean there is no physical quantity that is completely independent of its surroundings? Is there nothing like Absolute constant?” Well, at least this is what she thought until she realised this:
    It turns out, it is also possible that its value doesn’t change at all, whatever be the physical conditions, it doesn’t depend on anything, if you like. By the way, we call them universal constants. To our best knowledge their value remains the same anywhere or anytime in the universe. Gravitational constant is a universal constant. Universal constants often represent fundamental physical properties and relationships. 

“But what is their physical importance? Can we disintegrate them into basic physical properties at the end like we did with resistance. Maybe those properties would be inherent to our universe, these are the most fundamental, like universe’s traits and we can consider them as the blueprint of the universe maybe” she thought. ”I need to explore this!”

```yaml 
Constants can be seen as part of the 'blueprint' or inherent properties that define the structure and behaviour of our universe. Scientists continuously strive to refine the measurement accuracy of constants and understand their underlying nature. While there is ongoing research to improve precision, the nature of certain constants may be deeply rooted in the fabric of our universe, making it challenging to break them down into simpler components.
```

“But are we doing anything to break them down and understand them? or just keep calculating their accurate values ???” she questioned.

While constants are used to describe relationships between physical quantities, breaking them down into more basic properties is challenging. They often represent inherent characteristics of our universe and attempts to disintegrate them into more fundamental properties are limited by the current state of scientific understanding.

“I see, there are many things which remain constant in nature. Like the speed of light! It kind of governs the fundamental properties of electromagnetic waves. If we talk about the quantum scale, certain universal constants are deeply connected to the behaviour of particles. We can question why the mass of a proton is what it is and will end up with a question mark. But here's the cool part—this mass plays a super important role in shaping how atoms form and, in turn, how the whole universe comes together! These constants seem like nature's way of keeping everything in balance, creating a kind of cosmic order that we're still figuring out and marvelling at."
