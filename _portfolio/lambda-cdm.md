Lambda CDM Model of Cosmology

I am working as a Research Intern at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Indore in the department of astronomy, astrophysics and space engineering( DAASE). Here I have got the opportunity to work with the Lambda CDM model of Cosmology. This is a mathematical  model that describes the formation of the big bang from a single event, the Big bang, how it has evolved to its present state including the role of dark matter and dark energy in the formation structure and dynamics of galaxies and what could be the possible future of our universe. This model however has its own drawbacks and tensions which need to be resolved and this is a current area of research in the scientific world.  I am investigating the small-scale tensions within this model, such as the Core-Cusp problem, and employing simulations to understand the distribution of Dark Matter in galaxies.
