I have worked as a Research Trainee at the Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology (RRCAT), Indore. Here, I got the opportunity to work in the lab where we used  synchrotron radiation in fluorescence mode for EXAFS(Extended X-ray absorption fine structure which is the oscillating part of the spectrum) spectroscopy on diverse samples to determine coordination numbers. I operated the experimental hutch for sample scanning which was done by deploying the beam from the synchrotron. Also, I learned sample preparation using a KBR set and palletizer machine. Further we  plotted the data of absorption coefficient of the sample on OriginPro to make conclusions. This tenure broadened my experimental horizons  and I could gain proficiency in experimental methodologies and data analysis tools.
